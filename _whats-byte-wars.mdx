# What's Byte Wars?

Byte Wars is the official tutorial game for Electronic Arts Gaming Services (EAGS). 
It is intended to act as a sample project that can be used as a reference on the best practices to integrate our services into your game. 
We created Byte Wars from scratch as a fully functional offline game. This offline game was then brought online with the power of Electronic Arts platform by adding different services from each of our service areas like access, play and engagement. 
Every tutorial module walks you through a step by step guide to add a specific feature to Byte Wars which you can then translate into your own game. 
As a game developer, you can also jump to any specific tutorial module depending on your needs.
